# Maps
The purpose of this experiment is to test if the Google Maps API has the functionality that we need to support the nearest bus stop and directions features in our app. 

## Running this locally
This will require having python installed on your machine. Clone this repo and cd into the `maps` directory. If your python version is over 3.X run `python -m http.server`. If your python version is over 2.X run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. You can now visit `localhost:8000` in your browser to view the maps experiment.
