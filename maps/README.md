# JS Experiment
The purpose of this experiment is to test the front end framework we're using for our app and if the Google Maps API has the functionality that we need to support the nearest bus stop and directions features in our app. We are using React for our front end framework. We plan on using [this tool](https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps/) to help us work with both React and the Google Maps API. Details about our JS experiment are outlined in our design doc.
